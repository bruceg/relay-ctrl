This set of programs controls access to relaying for users that
authenticate using either POP3 using the qmail-popup/qmail-pop3d
or pop3front servers, or IMAP using Courier IMAP.

A mailing list has been set up to discuss this and other packages.

Development versions of relay-ctrl are available via anonymous CVS.
Set your CVSROOT to ":pserver:cvs@bruce-guenter.dyndns.org:/CVS",
login with an empty password, and check out the "relay-ctrl" module.

Requirements:

- You must be using either qmail-popup/qmail-pop3d or pop3front
  with either tcpserver or tcp-env to serve POP3 OR
- You must be using Courier IMAP to serve IMAP.
- You must be using tcpserver with qmail-smtpd or smtpfront to serve
  SMTP.

How to install:

- Check the definitions in the conf-* files.
- Run "make"
- As root, run "./installer"

How to configure it for use:

- Make sure the configuration defaults are appropriate for your system.
  See the man pages.

- Create the /var/spool/relay-ctrl/allow directory (or wherever you want
  the files to go).  Set the permissions on /var/spool/relay-ctrl to
  mode 700 (writeable only to root), and /var/spool/relay-ctrl/allow to
  mode 777 (world writeable)

- Create the /etc/relay-ctrl directory (or wherever you want the
  configuration to go)

- Put "/var/spool/relay-ctrl/allow" into the first line of
  "RELAY_CTRL_DIR" in the above configuration directory.

- If you want to have a fixup address (see the qmail FAQ) inserted into
  the RELAYCLIENT setting, put it into the first line of
  "RELAY_CTRL_RELAYCLIENT" in the configuration directory:
  :allow,RELAYCLIENT='@fixup'

- Add the following line to a file in /etc/cron.d.  This assumes a
  recent version of vixie cron.  Other versions of cron may use
  different syntax, and you may need to edit root's crontab.
* * * * * root envdir /etc/relay-ctrl /usr/sbin/relay-ctrl-age
  This step is optional, as relay-ctrl-check will delete and ignore old
  IP files.

- Modify your qmail-smtpd run file from:
	tcpserver ... qmail-smtpd
  to:
  	envdir /etc/relay-ctrl \
	relay-ctrl-chdir \
	tcpserver ... relay-ctrl-check qmail-smtpd

How to use with qmail-pop3d:

- Change your run file from:
  	tcpserver ... qmail-popup hostname checkpassword \
	qmail-pop3d
  to:
  	envdir /etc/relay-ctrl \
	relay-ctrl-chdir \
	tcpserver ... qmail-popup hostname checkpassword \
	relay-ctrl-allow \
	qmail-pop3d

How to use with pop3front

- Change your run file from:
  	tcpserver ... pop3front-auth cvm pop3front-maildir
  to:
  	envdir /etc/relay-ctrl \
	relay-ctrl-chdir \
	tcpserver ... pop3front-auth cvm \
	relay-ctrl-allow \
	pop3front-maildir

How to use with Courier IMAP:

- Make a symlink in /usr/lib/courier-imap/libexec/authlib to
  /usr/sbin/relay-ctrl-allow.

- Insert the command relay-ctrl-allow at the end of the list of
  authentication modules (AUTHMODULES) in
  /usr/lib/courier-imap/etc/imapd.

- You also need to modify the run file to execute
  "envdir /etc/relay-ctrl relay-ctrl-chdir" before starting couriertcpd,
  and I'm unsure where this needs to go.
