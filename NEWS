Changes in version 3.1.1

- Fixed the obvious bugs in relay-ctrl-udp (it didn't send an
  acknowledgement packet, among other things).

- Modified relay-ctrl-chdir to dup the opened directory file descriptor
  to the highest possible slot, to work around programs that close
  opened file descriptors (ie various Courier programs).

Changes in version 3.1

- relay-ctrl-allow now communicates the $USER and $DOMAIN variables to
  relay-ctrl-check.  relay-ctrl-send/relay-ctrl-udp don't handle this
  yet.

- Modified the function that creates IP files to first create a new
  temporary file and rename it to ensure the last-modified timestamp is
  updated.

- Added a relay-ctrl-chdir program, to open a directory so the
  relay-ctrl-* programs can inherit the opened FD to fchdir.  This
  allows all the programs to be executed non-setuid.

- Various portability bugs fixed in the libraries.

- Added a client-server pair for transmitting relay authorization
  information over UDP.

- Running relay-ctrl-age is no longer *required*, but still recommended.

- Removed check for standard input and standard output being sockets to
  allow relay-ctrl-allow to be used with SSL pipes.

- Check for the "::ffff:" IPv6 address prefix before validating address.

- Rules defined in the rules file now override the generated rules,
  instead of vice versa.
